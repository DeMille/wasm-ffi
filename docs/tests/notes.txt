Notes:

- Blanket.js is kinda old & can't parse es6 w/o throwing errors.
  I still wanted to see in-browser coverage so I'm building en es5
  version of wasm-ffi here.

- npm run dev runs a webpack dev server w/ babel

- build main.rs with:
    cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown && cp ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/test.wasm .\mod.rust.wasm

- build main.c with:
    wa compile main.c -o mod.c.wasm
